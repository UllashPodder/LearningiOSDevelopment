# How to Learn iOS Development


## Developer CV

## Developer Portfolio
What kind of projects should you build?
Start by looking at job boards and read throuhg the requirements. Look for jobs that you want. If you want to become a game developer, the requirements are very different than for a E-commerce app development. Here is an example of what you might see:
- proficiency with Swift or Objective C, and Cocoa Touch
- Xcode
- Auto Layout
- Familiarity with RESTful APIs to connect iOS applications to back-end services
- cloud message APIs and push notifications
- App architecture design
- Design patterns, MVC, MVVM, Coordinator pattern
- ARKit
- user authentication and user roles 
- Firebase, realm, or Core Data
- Sound knowledge of app user experience
- SwiftUI
- version control and Git
- unit testing
- Code reviews
- Command line
- Agile mindset
- Continuous integration
- clean code
- UML
- Sketch
- Jira, Conflunce, Bitbucket or similar

Make a list of the most common required skills and highligh them by priority. If you don't know a term, look it up.
This should also answer questions like "should I learn SwiftUI or UIKit?" - During the time of writing, the majority of jobs required UIKit. Mostly SwiftUI was a nice to have skill. Some job ads don't even mention UIKit because it is so essential. You can see they ask for UIKit when they include e.g. Auto Layout or Interface builder knowledge.

With your application you should try to demonstrate that you have all or most of the required skills. The hiring team is going to look for these skills in your application. The portfolio projects should demonstrate these skills sets. Make it easier for the hiring team by mentioning what skills you used for your projects. It is not about making a pretty UI, it is a demo of you coding skills. That being said, making a great looking UI is also a skill you will need and thus put some work in the UI part too.

### Example Project 1
